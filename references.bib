	abstract = {We have shown that Rpl3, a protein of the large ribosomal subunit from baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), is stoichiometrically monomethylated at position 243, producing a 3-methylhistidine residue. This conclusion is supported by top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry of Rpl3, as well as by biochemical analysis of Rpl3 radiolabeled in vivo with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-{3H]methionine.} The results show that a +14-Da modification occurs within the {GTKKLPRKTHRGLRKVAC} sequence of Rpl3. Using high-resolution cation-exchange chromatography and thin layer chromatography, we demonstrate that neither lysine nor arginine residues are methylated and that a 3-methylhistidine residue is present. Analysis of 37 deletion strains of known and putative methyltransferases revealed that only the deletion of the {YIL110W} gene, encoding a seven β-strand methyltransferase, results in the loss of the +14-Da modification of Rpl3. We suggest that {YIL110W} encodes a protein histidine methyltransferase responsible for the modification of Rpl3 and potentially other yeast proteins, and now designate it Hpm1 (Histidine protein methyltransferase 1). Deletion of the {YIL110W/HPM1} gene results in numerous phenotypes including some that may result from abnormal interactions between Rpl3 and the 25 S ribosomal {RNA.} This is the first report of a methylated histidine residue in yeast cells, and the first example of a gene required for protein histidine methylation in nature.},

	abstract = {Auxin a plant growth hormone, has a metabolic pathway that includes molecules and enzymes like those in animal brains. In this study, tomato plant seedlings (Lycopersicon esculenta) were used to investigate the fate of fluorine-tagged 5-hydroxytryptophan ({PF-5-HTP)} being developed for fluorine spectroscopy and imaging. Seedlings were treated with high or low concentrations of 5-{HTP} or {PF-5-HTP} and compared with controls. Metabolites of the {PF-5-HTP} were quantified using a custom immunoassay for the tag. Serotonin (5-{HT)} levels were measured with spectrofluorometry and thin-layer chromatography. Plants in treatment conditions had serotonin levels five to six times higher than controls. {PF-5-HTP} served as a precursor for serotonin in a biosynthetic pathway in this plant model, providing evidence for the bioavailability of the novel molecule. The increase in serotonin in plants grown in media culture supplemented with 5-{HTP} or {PF-5-HTP} might have useful applications in pharmacology.},

(1996) J Mol Biol 259, 995–1010]. Here we report that Tyr-154 is sulfated, not phosphorylated. Cationic and anionic trypsinogens were purified from human pancreatic juice and subjected to alkaline hydrolysis. Modified tyrosine amino-acids were separated on a Dowex cation-exchange column and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography. Both human cationic and anionic trypsinogens contained tyrosine-sulfate, but no tyrosine-phosphate, whereas bovine trypsinogen contained neither. Furthermore, incorporation of [{35S]SO4} into human cationic trypsinogen transiently expressed by human embryonic kidney {239T} cells was demonstrated. Mutation of Tyr-154 to Phe abolished radioactive sulfate incorporation, confirming that Tyr-154 is the site of sulfation in cationic trypsinogen. Sulfated pancreatic cationic trypsinogen exhibited faster autoactivation than a non-sulfated recombinant form, suggesting that tyrosine-sulfation of trypsinogens might enhance intestinal digestive zymogen activation in humans. Finally, sequence alignment revealed that the sulfation motif is only conserved in primate trypsinogens, suggesting that typsinogen sulfation is absent in other vertebrates.},

	abstract = {Posttranslational phosphorylation of proteins is an important event in many cellular processes. Whereas phosphoesters of serine, threonine and tyrosine have been extensively studied, only limited information is available for other amino acids modified by a phosphate group. The formation of phosphohistidine residues in proteins has been discovered in prokaryotic organisms as well as in eukaryotic cells. The ability to biochemically analyze phosphohistidine residues in proteins, however, is severely hampered by its extreme lability under acidic conditions. In our studies we have found that by replacing the phosphate linked to the histidine residue with a thiophosphate, a phosphohistidine derivative with increased stability is formed. This allows the analysis of phosphohistidine-containing proteins by established biochemical techniques and will greatly aid in the investigation of the role of this posttranslational modification in cellular processes.},

	abstract = {The distribution of dye-linked l-amino acid dehydrogenases was investigated in several hyperthermophiles, and the activity of dye-linked l-proline dehydrogenase (dye-l-{proDH}, l-proline:acceptor oxidoreductase) was found in the crude extract of some Thermococcales strains. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus profundus {DSM} 9503, which exhibited the highest specific activity in the crude extract. The molecular mass of the enzyme was about 160 {kDa}, and the enzyme consisted of heterotetrameric subunits (α2 β2) with two different molecular masses of about 50 and 40 {kDa.} The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the α-subunit (50-{kDa} subunit) and the β-subunit (40-{kDa} subunit) were {MRLTEHPILDFSERRGRKVTIHF} and {XRSEAKTVIIGGGIIGLSIAYNLAK}, respectively. Dye-l-{proDH} was extraordinarily stable among the dye-linked dehydrogenases under various conditions: the enzyme retained its full activity upon incubation at {70°C} for 10 min, and ca. 40\% of the activity still remained after heating at {80°C} for 120 min. The enzyme did not lose the activity upon incubation over a wide range of {pHs} from 4.0 to 10.0 at {50°C} for 10 min. The enzyme exclusively catalyzed l-proline dehydrogenation using 2,6-dichloroindophenol ({Cl2Ind)} as an electron acceptor. The Michaelis constants for l-proline and {Cl2Ind} were determined to be 2.05 and 0.073 {mM}, respectively. The reaction product was identified as Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate by thin-layer chromatography. The prosthetic group of the enzyme was identified as flavin adenine dinucleotide by high-pressure liquid chromatography. In addition, the simple and specific determination of l-proline at concentrations from 0.10 to 2.5 {mM} using the stable dye-l-{proDH} was achieved.},

	abstract = {Human axillary odor is formed by the action of Corynebacteria on
 odorless axilla secretions. Sulfanylalkanols, 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol in
 particular, form one key class of the odoriferous compounds. A conjugate with
 the dipeptide Cys-Gly has been reported as the secreted precursor for
 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol. Here, we confirm the Cys-Gly-(S)
 conjugate as the major precursor of this odorant, with lower levels of the
 Cys-(S) conjugate being present in axilla secretions. The enzymatic
 release of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol from the Cys-Gly-(S)
 conjugate by the axilla isolate Corynebacterium Ax20 was thus
 investigated. Cellular extracts of Ax20 released 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol
 from the Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate and from the Cys-(S)
 conjugate, whereas the previously isolated C-S lyase of this bacterial strain
 was only able to cleave the Cys-(S) conjugate.
 o-Phenanthroline blocked the release from the Cys-Gly-(S)
 conjugate but did not affect cleavage of the Cys-(S) conjugate,
 indicating that in a first step, a metal-dependent dipeptidase hydrolyzes the
 Cys-Gly bond. This enzyme was purified by four chromatographic steps and gel
 electrophoresis, and the partial amino acid sequence was determined. The
 corresponding gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. It
 codes for a novel dipeptidase with a high affinity toward the
 Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate of 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol. Co-incubating
 either the synthetic Cys-Gly-(S) conjugate or fresh axilla secretions
 with both the C-S lyase and the novel dipeptidase did release
 3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol, proving that the sequential action of these two
 enzymes from the skin bacterium Corynebacterium Ax20 does release the
 odorant from the key secreted precursor.},

	abstract = {This study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic ({TLC)} analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. When the chromatogram was sprayed with the indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70\% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. Succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. In addition, these organic acids showed different R(f) values. The total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. The proposed {TLC} method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five Bifidobacterium species. (Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve, B. infantis, B. bifidum, and B. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (Lactobacillus casei, L. bulgaricus, L. acidophilus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and S. lactis). Both spots of lactic acid and acetic acid were detected on all the {TLC} plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. The five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. Accordingly, the proposed {TLC} method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of Bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.},
