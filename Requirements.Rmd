## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this [@R-knitr]:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

(ref:pressure) Plot of pressure (open circles) as a function of temperature for a sample of air. 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:pressure)'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk producing Figure \@ref(fig:pressure) to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot [@R-base].

## Equations

RMarkdown can also include equations. These are entered using LaTeX format.

\begin{equation}
  [P]_{bound}=\frac{[P]_{total}[L]^n}{[L]^n+[L]_{0.5}^n}
  (\#eq:hill)
\end{equation}

If the equation is appropriately labeled, the equation will be numbered. References to the equations, like to Equation \@ref(eq:hill), should also work.

## References

```{r}

```
