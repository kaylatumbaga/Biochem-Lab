# BiochemLab

This project contains RMarkdown files which are intended to serve as templates for lab reports for
General Biochemistry. Much of the R code is intentionally incomplete, to allow students to complete
the code themselves. The code is also geared to process data from specific sources, namely the gel
analysis CSV files and the sequencing data files.

At present, the project contains files for four labs:
 - Pipetting practice
 - Protein Purification
 - Enzyme Kinetics
 - SNP Analysis

There is also a file to demonstrate helpful aspects of RMarkdown, a BibTeX file to use for
references, and a CSL file for the American Chemical Society referencing format.
